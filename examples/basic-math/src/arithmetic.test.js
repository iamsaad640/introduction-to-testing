// how to handle weired cases like adding 1 with '1' or not giving second argument etc
// answer to that is
// 1. fail gracefully (you know, who will do that)
// 2. if you don't know what to do, just throw an exception

// but this should not ‚ùåtes be an answer, that i don't know about it, let it happen as they are
